In time for [FOSS4G2013](http://2013.foss4g.org), we're happy to announce our new, updated [website](http://pycsw.org)!  Notable changes:

- a [blog](http://pycsw.org/blog) is now available, and part of [Planet OSGeo](http://planet.osgeo.org)
- new design using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), mobile friendly
- decoupled from main software documentation
- [publications](http://pycsw.org/publications) are now online

A big thanks goes out to [Ryan Clark](https://github.com/rclark) for putting the new website together.

If you're interested, full technical details of the change and implementation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/geopython/pycsw/issues/180).  Suggestions, ideas, and [contributions](https://github.com/geopython/pycsw/tree/website) are always welcome.  Enjoy!
